Here PYTHON codes are provided for different types of codes. The caption of the files will help to understand the job of the program. For example "matrix_matrix_example_convolutional_codes.m" shows an example of multiplying two matrices in a distributed fashion using Convolutional Codes, or "matrix_vector_example_polynomial_codes.m" shows an example of multiplying a vector with a matrix in a distributed fashion using Polynomial Codes. 


You can see details in our paper here https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08064. If you are using these codes for distributed matrix-matrix or matrix-vector muliplication, please cite us-

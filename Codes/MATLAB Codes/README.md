Here MATLAB codes are provided for different types of codes. The caption of the files will help to understand the job of the program. For example "matrix_matrix_example_convolutional_codes.m" shows an example of multiplying two matrices in a distributed fashion using Convolutional Codes, or "matrix_vector_condition_no_convolutional_code.m" provides the worst case condition number using convolutional codes over n workers and s stragglers. There are some helping functions like "khatrirao.m", "shiftrow.m", "matrix_vector_best_mat.m" or "matrix_matrix_best_mat.m".


You can see details in our paper here https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08064. If you are using these codes for distributed matrix-matrix or matrix-vector muliplication, please cite us-
